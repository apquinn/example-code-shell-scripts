## Name: Shell Scripts  
#### Description
These are examples of shell scripts I have written and maintained. These scripts start with a remote server running a fresh install of CentOS. Running the script will remotely log in, configure CentOS, install php, apache, Mariadb, Samba, WebMin, Unix tools, pagespeed, composer, certbot, inotify-tools, phpMyAdmin and git. All will be configured, code from NMU repositories will be pulled, certificates will be created and configured for Apache and databased replicated and ready to go.

#### Usage
These require a basic install of a CentOS server available for configuuration. You will be asked for the ip address during instillation.
